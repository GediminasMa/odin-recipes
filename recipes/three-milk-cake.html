    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>Â½ cup milk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1 cup whipped cream (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Grease a 10x15-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high
        until stiff peaks form; gradually beat in sugar until mixture is glossy.
        Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, combining each yolk before adding the
        next. Reduce mixer speed to medium and add flour, about 1 tablespoon at
        a time, to the mixture, beating continuously; beat in baking powder,
        milk, and vanilla extract. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly browned and a toothpick
        inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cake cool
        for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1 cup cream, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk in a
        blender and pulse several times until well blended. Pour three-milk
        mixture evenly over the cake. Refrigerate cake until cold and the milk
        mixture has soaked in, at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut in squares and top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a
        few sliced strawberries. Refrigerate leftovers.
      </li>
